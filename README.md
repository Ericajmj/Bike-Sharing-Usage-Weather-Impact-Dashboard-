# Bike-Sharing Usage & Weather Impact Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard with Python and Tableau)

## Project Objective

Analyze bike-sharing data to understand usage patterns, optimize availability, and identify the impact of weather conditions on ride frequency.

## Dataset Used

## Questions (KPIs)

1.	What are the peak bike usage times and conditions?
2.	How do weather factors (temperature, wind speed, and conditions) impact bike ride frequency?
3.	What are the trends in bike usage over time, and how does seasonality affect demand?
