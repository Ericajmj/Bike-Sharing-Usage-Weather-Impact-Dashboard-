# Bike-Sharing Usage & Weather Impact Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard with Python and Tableau)

## Project Objective

Analyze bike-sharing data to understand usage patterns, optimize availability, and identify the impact of weather conditions on ride frequency.

## Dataset Used

-	<a href="https://github.com/Ericajmj/Bike-Sharing-Usage-Weather-Impact-Dashboard-/commit/19b54c62d8e7f0d991ca6f25f186507bb39240f9 ">Dataset </a>


## Questions (KPIs)

1.	What are the peak bike usage times and conditions?
2.	How do weather factors (temperature, wind speed, and conditions) impact bike ride frequency?
3.	What are the trends in bike usage over time, and how does seasonality affect demand?

## Process

Processed and cleaned 173,978 rows of bike-sharing data using Python (pandas), including renaming columns, adjusting data types, and normalizing humidity values for consistency. Created an interactive Tableau dashboard with 5 visualizations to explore bike usage in relation to weather conditions.

## Project Insight

The analysis revealed that bike usage peaks under certain weather conditions (clear skies and mild temperatures), while rain and extreme weather significantly reduce demand. Seasonal trends highlighted higher activity in summer months, providing actionable insights for inventory and availability planning.
